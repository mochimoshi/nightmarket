There will be food, performances, and games, reminiscent of Taiwan’s vibrant night life.

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <h4>What permits are needed?</h4>
        <p><strong>There are two permits required: a temporary seller's permit (which must be registered at <%= link_to 'https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe', 'https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe' %>) and a temporary event health permit, included as part of the package.</strong> California requires all vendors to apply for a temporary seller’s permit with the California Board of Equalization - a permit for sales of taxable items. Registration is free and can be done at <%= link_to 'https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe', 'https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe' %>. <strong>Please mail a copy to us once you are done!</strong> Please use the following address for the temporary special event:</p>
        <address>
          519 Lasuen Mall<br />
          Stanford University<br />
          Stanford, CA 94305<br />
        </address>
        <p>A food sales permit will be provided as part of the package. <strong>No cooking is allowed on site. All food preparation must be performed at a health department approved commercial kitchen</strong> - we highly encourage preparing the food at your own facilities, then selling prepackaged food at the event for simplicity. <strong>Please provide a copy of your restaurant facility permit as well.</strong> This is required as part of the temporary health permit. Please note that potentially hazardous foods (e.g. meat, dairy) need to be kept below 45 degrees Fahrenheit or above 135 degrees Fahrenheit through heating elements or cooling containers.</p>
        <h4>Are alcohol sales allowed?</h4>
        <p>Alcohol sales are not allowed at the Stanford Night Market.</p>
        <h4>How does the ticketing system work?</h4>
        <p>To reduce the problem of dealing with money and change, visitors will use tickets (priced at 50 cents each) to purchase items. We will exchange tickets for either the cash or check amount at the end of the event. You are entitled to 100% of any profits made by your booth.</p>
        <h4>What are the cooking regulations?</h4>
        <p>Please cover open cooking equipment to avoid contamination. We will provide containers to dump out used oil. <strong>Dumping oil on the ground or grass is strictly prohibited, and you will be fined if there are stains or destruction of property in your booth space.</strong> Since tent space is limited, cooking should be done at a separate, health department approved commerical facility, then transporting prepackaged food to Night Market to sell.</p>
        <h4>Will there be water available for cooking or drinking?</h4>
        <p>Vendors are responsible for their own chafing dishes and heating supplies, lights, banners and signage, additional tables, as well as five gallons of 100°F warm water for hand washing.</p>
        <h4>How should items be priced?</h4>
        <p>Prices should reflect reasonable market rates. Night markets are known for having great bargains, and customers are price sensitive. We recommend selling in volume at lower prices. The Stanford Night Market reserves the right to set a maximum price as necessary.</p>
        <h4>Who should I contact if I have any more questions?</h4>
        <p>Contact information goes here</p>
        <h3>Thank you! Best of luck, and we hope to see you soon!</h3>
