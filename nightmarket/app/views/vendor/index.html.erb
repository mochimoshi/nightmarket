        <h2 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq-text" class="clickable" style="cursor: pointer">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div id="faq-text" class="collapse in">
          <h4>What permits are needed?</h4>
          <p><strong>The vendor package includes a temporary event health permit. Additionally, please provide a copy of your restaurant facility permit and a temporary seller’s permit. California requires all vendors to apply for a temporary seller’s permit with the California Board of Equalization (a permit for sales of taxable items). Registration is free and can be done at <%= link_to 'https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe', 'https://efile.boe.ca.gov/ereg/index.boe' %>. </strong></p>
          <!-- <p>A food sales permit will be provided as part of the package. <strong>No cooking is allowed on site. All food preparation must be performed at a health department approved commercial kitchen</strong> - we highly encourage preparing the food at your own facilities, then selling prepackaged food at the event for simplicity. <strong>Please provide a copy of your restaurant facility permit as well.</strong> This is required as part of the temporary health permit. Please note that potentially hazardous foods (e.g. meat, dairy) need to be kept below 45 degrees Fahrenheit or above 135 degrees Fahrenheit through heating elements or cooling containers.</p> -->

          <h4>What does the prepaid vendor package not include?</h4>
          <p>Vendors are responsible for their own chafing dishes and heating supplies, banners and signage, any additional tables.</p>

          <h4>Is there a certain way that food must be prepared?</h4>
          <p>No cooking is allowed on site. All food preparation must be performed at a health department approved commercial kitchen. Please note that potentially hazardous foods (e.g. meat, dairy) need to be kept below 45 degrees Fahrenheit or above 135 degrees Fahrenheit through heating elements or cooling containers. In accordance with health regulations of the state of California, food must be purchased and consumed within four hours of cooking/preparation even if the food is stored and reheated later.</p>


          <h4>Is there a certain way that food must be served?</h4>
          <p>All food must be individually packaged (in a sealed bag, box, or other container) prior to the event, in a certified facility (e.g. approved commercial kitchen). All packaged food must have a label for the time at which it was packaged, and must be purchased and consumed within four hours of that timestamp.  No food can be in open containers or exposed to air until after it has been sold to consumers.</p>

          <h4>Will there be a space for waste disposal?</h4>
          <p>Stanford Night Market provides general waste disposal. Dumping oil or other cooking materials onto grass or public spaces is strictly prohibited.</p>

          <h4>Are alcohol sales allowed?</h4>
          <p>Alcohol sales are not allowed at the Stanford Night Market.</p>

          <h4>How should items be priced?</h4>
          <p>Prices should reflect reasonable market rates. Night markets are known for having great bargains, and customers are price sensitive. We recommend selling in volume at lower prices. The Stanford Night Market reserves the right to set a maximum price as necessary.</p>



<!--         <h4>What are the cooking regulations?</h4>
        <p>Please cover open cooking equipment to avoid contamination. We will provide containers to dump out used oil. <strong>Dumping oil on the ground or grass is strictly prohibited, and you will be fined if there are stains or destruction of property in your booth space.</strong> Since tent space is limited, cooking should be done at a separate, health department approved commerical facility, then transporting prepackaged food to Night Market to sell.</p>
 -->
<!-- 
        <h4>Will there be water available for cooking or drinking?</h4>
        <p>Vendors are responsible for their own chafing dishes and heating supplies, lights, banners and signage, additional tables, as well as five gallons of 100°F warm water for hand washing.</p>
